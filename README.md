## Dynamic Online Survey

This is a dynamic online survey spanning across multiple pages making use of reactjs and react-router-dom.
The state is maintained across the application even with browser back/forward navigation as well as 
reopening the tab later on. 
There is also a progressbar that tells how much of the survey has been completed.
Hope you enjoy taking the survey!
